# The Beer O'Clock Clock

A simple website which tells you where in the world it is beer o'clock (5PM) at the moment. The site is hosted on [beeroclock.site](https://beeroclock.site/).

Link to the project on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/8eTt2jOo/beeroclock-site).

## Usage

If you want to use/host the code on your own domain, please take note of the service workers used to make this website workable offline. Mainly the `js/swreg.js`, `sw.js` and `manifest.json` files. Update these accordingly to reflect the URL of your domain. Also note that if you don't serve your site over HTTPS, this functionality will not work, so you might just as well remove it.

Also I ask that you leave a link to the original project or my name with a link to my GitHub profile as attribution. Thanks :)
